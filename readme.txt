Congratulations! You've stumbled upon a Tank-B profiles pack, created using gear I had lying around or borrowed from Mr. Bassberserk (head over to YouTube, search for "Bassberserk," and subscribe to the channel). While everyone else is making profiles of Ampegs and stuff, I'm profiling an ancient Yamaha preamp with a guitar overdrive pedal. Why? Because DIY is fun and authentic. Basically, this pack is for anyone who appreciates a down-to-earth and genuine approach to sound.

All profiles are more or less adjusted for volume, eq values:

Everything with Yamaha:
Treble: 10 kHz ± 18 dB
Mid: 500 Hz ± 10 dB
Low: 150 Hz ± 12 dB

Wine Cellar:
Treble: 10 kHz ± 18 dB
Mid: 4 kHz ± 10 dB (имитация ручки Harmonics)
Low: 150 Hz ± 12 dB

MXR M80:
Treble: 4 kHz ± 12 dB
Mid: 850 Hz ± 10 dB 
Low: 60 Hz ± 18 dB 

Ampeg BA-115:
Treble: 10 kHz ± 12 dB
Mid: 500 Hz ± 10 dB 
Low: 60 Hz ± 18 dB 

A little about what do we got here:
1. AMT TubeMagnum - power of Siberia, taiga herbs and warmth of a Soviet tube. An old and long discontinued overdrive pedal by AMT with a characteristic nasal tone with a lot of high mids. I had it in my loop imitation with Yamaha, and also as a little gift for fellow guitarists
2. Caline CP-60 Wine Cellar - something like a budget SansAmp copy. Why would I make a profile of a SansAmp copy where there are loads of SansAmp profiles out there? Great question, good that you asked
3. Yamaha BE200 - Japanese preamp from the 60s, it was a kit with a poweramp and acted as a head. Thanks to two channels mixing to one output, it can be used to balance the driven channel with a clean one, and for that purpose it has been used mercilessly
4. Caline CP-65 The Widow - bass overdrive that works good as a warmer. I did not use it for that purpose at all, by the way
5. MXR M80 - needs no introduction
6. Ampeg BA-115 - a combo amp
7. Caline CP-82 Foe Hammer - bitch

If you want to say thanks - you are welcome
